# Constitution project of the GRH student council
This is the project of the GRH student house council. The aim of the project is to have one source of truth where the student house council itself can push it's constitution onto with detailed comments of changes and a history of those.

Please feel free to read the [constitution][CONSTITUTION.md]. If you are a tenant or a SHC member and have found an issue, please open an issue so we can keep on tracking and resolve them, soon.
